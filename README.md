## Shouting Machine

#### By Brian Scherner

#### An application that makes words capitalized.

## Description

This application allows users to input words or sentences into a form, which will take those words and capitalize them once the form is submitted.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

I would like to revisit this application later and update it to increase the font size with each form submission. I plan to do this as I learn more about JavaScript.
